 * Due: 3th May 2024, 7:00pm

## Course Description

- Credits: 4

An investigation of select topics in computer and information science that prepares students for the completion of a senior project with the purpose of identifying knowledge gaps in the discipline. Students learn how to read scholarly papers, state and motivate research questions, create a software prototype or develop scholarly artifacts to address their findings, and collect and organize evidence for evaluating the outcome of their project. During a weekly laboratory session students use industry-grade technology to gain practical skills in technical writing, the presentation of technical concepts, and the production of an artifact. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions. Prerequisite: Permission of instructor. 


## Distribution Requirements

None 

## Learning Outcomes

Students learn to begin and complete an academic research project. In this task, students learn how to;

- Illustrate a component of a viable and appropriate open-source research project idea.
- Identify appropriate sources to motivate the research idea and determine research project objectives.
- Demonstrate feasibility of a research idea through an application of existing computational resources.
- Describe a research idea, its motivation, goals, and anticipated outcomes in writing.

## Policies

### Grading 

Use your [Gradebook Repository](https://classroom.github.com/a/lBuCX8Nw) to receive updates from the instructor. The repository is only for receiving reports -- you will never have to post to this repository.

### Grading Scale

The grade that a student receives in this class will be based on the following categories. All percentages are approximate and, if the need to do so presents itself, it is possible for the assigned percentages to change during the academic semester.

|Category              | Percentage | Assessment metric
|:-------------------- | :--------- | :-----------------
|Class Participation   | 40%        | check mark grade
|Departmental Project  | 30%        | letter grade
|Own Project           | 30%        | letter grade
|Total                 | 100%       |

#### Grading Scale

|Letter| Range |Letter |Range |Letter|Range|
|:------------|:-----------|:------------|:-----------|:------------|:-----------|
|A            | 96 - 100   |A-           | 90 - 95.9  |
|B+           | 87 - 89.9  |B            | 83 - 86.9  |B-           | 80 - 82.9  |
|C+           | 77 - 79.9  |C            | 73 - 76.9  |C-           | 70 - 72.9  |
|D+           | 67 - 69.9  |D            | 63 - 66.9  |F           | 59.9 and below  |

### Definitions of Grading Categories

- __Class Participation__: All students are required to actively participate during all of the class sessions. Your participation will take forms such as completing in-class exercises, leading a discussion session in class, engaging in peer review procesws wigh both fellow 580 and 610 students, complete activities as a part of a joint-session on Fridays with the 610 course.

- __Development of Departmental Project__: You will be given a project idea from the department to conduct a literature review, a method selection, an implementation of an artifact, complete prototype development, perform testing and complete an analysis of experimental results. At the completion of this project, you will submit a report of the idea.

- __Development of Own Project__: This project will present you with an opportunity to design and implement a correct and carefully evaluated project. Completion of the final project will require you to apply **all** of the work and skills that you have already acquired in the course during the semester to address a research problem. At the completion of this project, you will submit a proposal of your own idea. The details for the final project will be given in class.

### Assignment Submission

Your class instructor will be using GitHub Classroom to collect all assignments. It is expected that you are able to effectively use `git` to submit your work. If you require help, please see your peers, the Technology Leaders, or your instructor.

All assignments will have a stated due date. The electronic version of the class assignments are to be turned in at the beginning of the lab session on that due date. Submissions after the beginning of class are counted as being late. Assignments will be accepted for up to one week past the assigned due date with a 15% penalty. All late assignments must be submitted at the beginning of the session that is scheduled one week after the due date. The honor code (see below) is assumed for all submitted work.

### Attendance

It is mandatory for all students to attend the class and laboratory sessions. If you will not be able to attend a session, then please see/email the course instructor at least one week in advance to describe your situation. Students who miss more than five unexcused classes, laboratory sessions, or group project meetings will have their final grade in the course reduced by one letter grade. Students who miss more than ten of the aforementioned events will automatically fail the course.

### Late Submissions

All assignments will have a stated due date and a late deadline (the latest date that an assignment will be accepted -- up to a week after the deadline). The electronic version of the class assignments are to be turned in at the beginning of the lab session on the due date. Submissions after the beginning of class are counted as being late.

__Assignments will be accepted for up to one week past the assigned due date with a 15% penalty. After that time, the lab will not be accepted.__

__Please note, lab solutions will be discussed after the one week late submission deadline. Therefore, any submission of the assignments following that deadline will not be possible.__

### Extensions

Unless special arrangements are made with the course instructor, __no assignments will be accepted after the late deadline.__ If you are requesting extensions for a lab assignment, then you are to email me with your request and also provide a _valid_ reason for your extension. This request must come before the due date of the lab and __not__ on the due date.

The decision to provide you with an extension (or not) will be weighed in light of fairness to your peers who are still able to complete their labs, regardless of their own busy schedules.

### A note on extenuating circumstances

If you should find yourself in difficult circumstances that significantly interfere with your ability to prepare for this class and to complete assignments, please inform me immediately so that we can work something out together! Do not wait until the last day of class to ask for exceptions to what is stated in this syllabus. In such a situation, you may also find it helpful to contact one of the available resources on campus:

- [Maytum Center for Student Success](https://sites.allegheny.edu/learningcommons/)
- [Allegheny College Counseling Center](https://sites.allegheny.edu/learningcommons/)
- [The Winslow Health Center](https://sites.allegheny.edu/healthcenter/)
- [Student Life](https://sites.allegheny.edu/studentlife/)

### Communication

Various digital channels will be used in this course for communication, including email, Discord, and the GitHub issue tracker. It is strongly advised for the student to install the Discord app on their computer and smart-phone to be sure to receive all communications from the instructor, as well as, the other members of the class.

Additionally, the course website will be used to store the syllabus, course schedule and information about the `classDocs/` repository using the GitHub.  Your grades will be communicated to you by a Gradebook GitHub repository.

### Bring your own computer to class

The classrooms in the Department of Computer Science no longer provide machines for student use. You are to bring your own wifi-ready device to class to be able to follow along with course material. If the class is meeting online using Zoom, then please be sure that you machine is configured correctly to use these services to connect you to the class. As it is your responsibility to maintain your machine, please perform online research to determine how to configure your machine accordingly, or to install any necessary software to enable online meetings.

During the semester, you will be told which software to install on your machine to be prepared for class. Some of the prominent software that we may be using can be found at the following [resource](https://www.oliverbonhamcarter.com/resources/dataanalytics_resources/).

### Special Needs and Disability Services

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal anti-discrimination statute that provides comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with disabilities.  Among other things, this legislation requires all students with disabilities be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for reasonable accommodation of their disabilities. Students with disabilities who believe they may need accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact Disability Services at 332-2898. Disability Services is part of the Learning Commons and is located in Pelletier Library. Please do this as soon as possible to ensure that approved accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion.

Some of the resources on campus are listed below.

- [Maytum Center for Student Success](https://sites.allegheny.edu/studentsuccess/)
- [Allegheny College Counseling Center](https://sites.allegheny.edu/counseling/)
- [The Winslow Health Center](https://sites.allegheny.edu/healthcenter/)
- [Student Life](https://sites.allegheny.edu/studentlife/)
- [Student Accessibility and Support Services](https://sites.allegheny.edu/studentaccessibility/)

### Honor Code

The Academic Honor Program that governs the entire academic program at Allegheny College is described in the Allegheny Course Catalogue.  The Honor Program applies to all work that is submitted for academic credit or to meet non-credit requirements for graduation at Allegheny College.  This includes all work assigned for this class (e.g., examinations, laboratory assignments, and the final project).  All students who have enrolled in the College will work under the Honor Program.  Each student who has matriculated at the College has acknowledged the following pledge:

_I hereby recognize and pledge to fulfill my responsibilities, as defined in the Honor Code, and to maintain the integrity of both myself and the College community as a whole._

It is recognized that an important part of the learning process in any course, and particularly one in computer science, derives from thoughtful discussions with teachers and fellow students.  Such dialogue is encouraged. However, it is necessary to distinguish carefully between the student who discusses the principles underlying a problem with others and the student who produces assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on, someone else's work.  While it is acceptable for students in this class to discuss their programs, technical diagrams, proposals, paper reviews, presentations, and other items with their classmates or other individuals, deliverables that are nearly identical to the work of others will be taken as evidence of violating the Honor Code.

More information about the code may be found at the [Maytum Center for Student Success](https://sites.allegheny.edu/studentsuccess/academic-honor-program/)

### Welcome to Computer Science Research!

Types of computer hardware and software are everywhere! Conducting research in computer science is a challenging and rewarding activity that leads to the production of hardware, software, and scientific insights that have the potential to positively influence the lives of many people.  As you learn more about research methods in computer science you will also enhance your ability to effectively write and speak about a wide range of topics in computer science. I ask that you bring your best effort and highest enthusiasm as you pursue research in computer science this semester.

### Schedule
